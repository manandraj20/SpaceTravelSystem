# SpaceTravelSystem
In this problem, we will implement a Space Travel System (STS) in C++ language using Objected Oriented Programming Concepts. In this STS, the traveller should be able to book a ticket to a planet from a source planet on a specified date. The traveller should also have an optional choice of booking a return ticket.

To run the program
git clone <this repo url>
cd SpaceTravelSystem
run the command `make clean` and then `make main` and then to run the executable type `.\main`
